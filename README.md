# END-To-END-Game-Analytics
The Game Analytics: Unlocking Tennis Data with SportRadar API project is designed to build an end-to-end sports analytics solution focused on professional tennis competitions. The project leverages the Sportradar API to extract structured and unstructured tennis data, stores it in a relational database, and presents the information through an interactive Streamlit application. This enables sports analysts, organizers, and enthusiasts to explore competition structures, monitor player rankings, and gain actionable insights into global tennis events.
The first stage of the project focuses on data acquisition. Using Python, multiple Sportradar API endpoints were queried, including Competitions, Complexes, and Doubles Competitor Rankings. The retrieved JSON responses, often deeply nested, were transformed into flat relational structures for storage. Each dataset was mapped to well-defined SQL tables such as Categories, Competitions, Complexes, Venues, Competitors, and Competitor_Rankings. Primary and foreign keys ensured referential integrity, while indexing optimized query performance.

Once the database schema was in place, SQL analysis was performed to derive meaningful insights. For competitions, queries identified top categories by event count, filtered doubles events, analyzed parentâ€“child tournament relationships, and examined event type distributions. Venue analysis revealed the geographical spread of tennis infrastructure, highlighting countries and complexes that frequently host events. Competitor rankings analysis provided leaderboards, stable ranking trends, and country-based performance summaries.

The second stage involved developing an interactive Streamlit application connected to the SQL database. The app includes a Homepage Dashboard with key statistics such as the total number of competitors, countries represented, and highest points scored. Users can search for competitors, apply filters by rank, country, and points, and view detailed competitor profiles. Country-level analytics summarize the number of competitors and average points per nation, while leaderboards display top-ranked players and those with the highest point scores.

Key insights derived from the analysis highlight patterns in professional tennis. Certain countries consistently dominate the top rankings, likely reflecting advanced player development programs. Doubles competitions, while fewer in number, display high ranking stability among top players, suggesting consistent partnerships and performance. Venue analysis showed a concentration of events in a small number of complexes, indicating infrastructure centralization. Ranking stability analysis revealed that players with minimal week-to-week movement often come from countries with established tennis governance.

The project faced several challenges, including API rate limits, the complexity of nested JSON data, and the need for query optimization on large datasets. These were addressed through techniques such as caching, recursive JSON parsing, and indexing frequently queried database fields.

Deliverables include Python scripts for API integration and data transformation, SQL scripts for schema creation and queries, a fully functional Streamlit web application, and comprehensive documentation. The project is evaluated on data accuracy, database design quality, query performance, application functionality, and insight clarity.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates practical expertise in API integration, database management, SQL analytics, and interactive dashboard development. It transforms raw sports data into a powerful decision-support system, enabling users to explore and understand the competitive landscape of professional tennis in an intuitive and insightful manner.
